# Mechanical Habits

## What are habits?

*A habit is an action which is done regularly by one, often done without even knowing.*

A habit is something quite natural and self-conducted. Mechanical can also mean without thoughts; some habits are mechanical whilst most are not. Mechanical habits are usually adopted by the brain itself, and thus it's incredibly difficult to attempt to break it.


## Why mechanical habits?

Mechanical habits are programmed habits to last for a lifetime. So, we can attempt to exploit our brain's obsession with patterns to form a habit that is advantageous to us. Attempting to initiate such a practice may be easy but maintaining it at the very first seconds is quite tough until your brain gets fully accustomed to it. A significant amount of time is taken by the brain to get used to routines. For this reason, it's essential you have a good start, and this post is all about that!

## Start

It may be as easy for some to start and as difficult as breaking a mountain for others. Everyone's brain has their own method of functioning but the main keynote is discipline. Without self-discipline, you can scratch the idea of building a habit.


### How do I become disciplined?

Discipline is the self-culture to control oneself often in the form of rules, and if broken, there's likely going to be punishments. You can build your discipline based on very **simplistic** concepts. Prior to becoming disciplined, there are some prerequisites!

1. Trust\
You should trust yourself to the fullest. One should absolutely believe in themselves and their capabilities. There isn't anyone beside yourself that your brain knows, so your discipline shouldn't depend on others. Staying put in the past leads to nowhere, the present is forever advancing and you should give yourself more chances.

2. Willpower\
Everything you will ever accomplish literally depends on your willpower. Willpower is a huge part of discipline, but your willpower will never be constant nor will you have an infinite amount of it. You should be determined to reach your goals at all costs; if you're not, then the goals you've set aren't meant for you.

3. Desires and temptations\
Ranging from the wants to watch a TikTok of five seconds to *the hub*; these are all temptations. It's getting increasingly hard to control our temptations nowadays when everything we could ever wish for literally lies on our screens. This is exactly why we want to try our best to resist things. Temptations will always be there, and it's up to you to resist them. Giving into them could drain off your motivations and willpower.

To be disciplined implies overcoming your weakness and finding your strength so that you can stand for yourself in whatever situations. It may be hard at times but know that everyone experiences these situations more than once in their life.


### Building Habits

Now that discipline has been covered, we are a few steps away from the main goal of this post. Discipline and habits are dependent on each other and closely intertwined; without one the other can't exist.

Habits are all around us, good and bad. From brushing your teeth before going to sleep to watching ten hours of TikTok and YouTube content daily, these are all habits. Before starting, it's important that you know exactly what you want; take a short pause and consider:

* Who you want to be

* The goals you want to accomplish

* Things which may stop you

* How you could combat these things

You can even write these points out in your diary or a piece of paper and elaborate even more on them. Don't think of them in a general picture, consider every little detail and go to the root. You need to have a plan of everything you want to accomplish!

We cannot start a habit if we don't have a proper routine. How do I know if I have a proper routine? It's a rather simple question, you go to sleep at a reasonable almost constant time daily and wake up at the same time without any excuse. As simple as it sounds, it is the basics.


### A proper basic routine

If you do not have a good and proper routine, it's absolutely fine. It's quite funny but even the basic stuff has to be planned sometimes. Get a piece of paper and a pen, because the brain has more important stuff to recall. 

1. Write out a good hour of the day that you should wake up, this could vary for everyday of the wake but it has to be there. Seven o'clock, half past six or half past seven, it is up to you to decide!

2. Do the same thing except for bedtimes now. Keep account for an eight-hour sleep, it should neither be less nor more than eight.

3. We now have our waking up time and bedtime. Add everything in between from here: reading a book, going for a walk on Mondays, partying for two hours on Tuesday; it is up to you! Just make sure that every time has a strict time of when it starts and when it ends.

4. Leave some space for expansion. We'll discuss about this in the ***How To Habits*** sectionâ€¦

5. If your timetable is overflowing, cut things out and make space for unexpected day-to-day activities.

And now you have an ideal routine on paper. After finalising this routine, you shouldn't allow yourself to cut anything out and everything mentioned in it should be followed. It effectively helps you to be more disciplined.


### How To Habits

From here, it is completely straightforward to start a habit. Based on the points that you reflected on earlier, your new habit likely will not be a bad one. A habit should be beneficial to you in a sort of way, and there needs to be a certain motif behind it. Having a reason for practising something will keep you motivated until you finally adopt it as an actual habit. For better understanding, let's assume that my new habit is going on a fifteen minutes' walk.

`I want to have a fifteen minutes' walk every day to take a break from life and work. A walk because it's more beneficial for my eyes which are constantly staring into screens.`

In my head, it has to be well and clear that I have a task that I must complete daily. As mentioned above, there also needs to be a reason. Your reason will serve as a motif and you could use it to get the willpower and stop procrastinatingâ€¦ Of course, the new habit will not come naturally, unless you're used to the habit, so you have to allocate some time of your day to focus on that particular thing. It has to be planned. If you plan your things out, you'd find it more motivating to stick to it.


#### The fourteen days method

The fourteen days method is a powerful method you can use to ensure that all goes according to plan. It consists of attempting something for just two weeks, with serious discipline.

You're trying to build a habit but whether you like it or not, you should only give yourself two weeks to adapt to the routine. Allow yourself to modify it only after the first two weeks. Stay put to the routine for these fourteen days, and at no costs should you break it!

## My personal experience

***This section speaks about the experience I had testing out this method of creating new habits.***

I used to have a really chaotic life which was emotionally and physically draining. It was deeply unhealthy! I would go to sleep at around half past three in the morning and wake up around eleven o'clock in the morning. This was a routine, a nasty one. It wasn't the real me and I wasn't happy with the way my life was going. I was indulging myself to be a loser. 

Being friends with the wrong people isn't any good. Whether you like it or not, your friends are huge influential figures to you, and sooner or later, you'd start adopting their habits, so will they adopt your habits. If you're spending your entire day and life with that person, it's inevitable to avoid the influence. Choose your friends and people of your surroundings wisely. ðŸ˜‰

***Sometimes to gain, you must also lose!***

Yeah, my life was going downhill. I've tried to change multiple times but nothing worked, I gave up only to go back to the same regime. Nothing I tried worked. I didn't have a goal behind my habits, my goal was just because I needed to do the habits. It wasn't enough to keep me motivated.

During the month of November, I decided on trying something new. Assign habits to things I liked. I knew that this too could potentially fail. As a preventive measure, I set out to try the habit for two weeks. After those two weeks, If I didn't like it, I'd stop. If it needed to be modified, I'd only modify it after the time has elapsed and retry again. If I liked it, I'd keep it ongoing.

I went through all the steps I've mentioned above. Discipline, I didn't have it but I was going to earn it! I had a proper bedtime and wake up time, a timetable of what to do. It was already one o'clock in the morning after I was done setting my plan for the week and my alarms. I wasted no time and went to sleep. Morning came quickly, I was exhausted. Driven by pure willpower, I woke up. There was no time for any distractions and surely no time to procrastinate. Once you're on your two feet in the morning, it only gets easier from there.

Part of my discipline format was to cut off distractions. As heart wrenching as it is, you either set a timer to your distractions or delete them completely. I had chosen the timer option, and this truly helped to reduce my screen time and helped me become more productive. 

*I was reluctant at first, but after the first four days, it all became natural.*


### What came out of it?

Three weeks and a half have already elapsed since I started this routine and I am proud to say that it has worked. I didn't get here on my first try, and it definitely took a lot of tries to get to where I am.

# Conclusion

Building habits or even a habit is not an easy task, and it could actually take a lot of tries before it actually becomes a *mechanical* habit. 

The take away from this post is that you shouldn't give up on anything. Even if you have given up, it's never too late to retry. As reluctant or hard as it sounds, it will count if you just give it a try.
