# Teenagers Relationships

## Introduction
Teenage is that sweet period of life. Pimples, acne, pubic hair and general puberty changes are experienced by almost everyone during this time. These are absolutely normal changes as the mind and the body both develop, leaving childhood to adulthood. During this time, there is rapid mental and physical development.

Teenage relationships have been here all along from the stone era, although it has been quite different. Most teenagers will experience their first love during adolescence, and almost everyone who has experienced it will be able to tell you how premature it was. To be honest, having a failed relationship isn't a huge matter, host people just move on fairly quickly and take it as a learning opportunity.

## E-Dating

Recently, thanks to the internet and the whole world basically being intertwined through technology and social media platforms, teenage relationships have been taking a rather strange turn. The goal of social networking platforms is to connect people together. However, these connections are quite worrying for our teenager relationships. Everyone, literally everyone can become anonymous on the internet if they are smart about it, yes even your 65-year-old grandpa. Open Discord, get a brand-new email address, create an account and you're all set.

With a Discord account, you can pretend to be whoever you would like and never get caught if you're smart about it. This is simply too ideal for paedophiles. They'll just find a random teen dating server, join in and maybe pretend to be a teen too. Just the thought of it is disgusting to me! Some teenagers who clearly don't know any better will certainly fall trap to these horrible people. These teenagers are often desperate for love and attention, so with someone pretending to love them, they definitely will believe that it's true love. A lot of them will end up believing that the person is true to their words, which is not true in most cases. 

It's not just with paedophiles but most of these online relationships are just premature and will never work! People are completely different online and in real life. Just a selfie or sometimes not even that, and teenagers believe that the person is their true love and soulmate. Wake up, just because someone flirts with you, it doesn't mean that they are your soulmate.
True love is real, but it's certainly not what teenagers think. A relationship between two people from two different countries from two completely different spots on the globe will certainly not work. Unless you actually know the person in real life, online relationships are doomed to fail.

I think that most teenagers are wasting their time and energy online dating. Most of these teens don't realise what they are missing out until it's quite late. Life is beautiful, and no relationships should be constrained to screens and social media! You're missing out, awesome time that you could have spent with someone in a field or somewhere of your choice hanging out. 

My point isn't to prove that Discord and other similar technologies are bad but that it's starting to become detrimental to youngsters. I've never believed that completely cutting something was ever a solution, but awareness is.

## Desperate Relationships

Most of us teens are extremely quick to jump to the conclusion of "having a crush on someone". Just because someone makes you happy, it doesn't mean you have to force yourself to be in a relationship with them. Heading into a relationship with blindfolds and then coming out with a completely shattered heart and sobs all over the place; it's not worth it! Instead of having a great friendship with that person, that opportunity has somewhat been ruined. 

Quit believing that love at first sight is real. Love at first sight is literally dumb and literally never works; you can't just love someone because they look beautiful. Love should be for who the person truly is, not just about physical beauty. "I've fallen for this really hot guy but he treats me like trash. I don't care, I still love him!" Whenever I hear these, I just burst into laughter. If someone doesn't respect you nor treat you properly, then wanting to be in a relationship with that person is just waiting for chaos to strike. Likely, the person will never change their attitude towards you. That person is certainly and will never be worth your time nor love. It's crazy how this *fake* love can be blinding to some.
You shouldn't say yes to anyone who confesses to you. They may look hot but just remember that you're worthy. No matter how desperate you are you shouldn't even have to consider saying yes, unless the person is someone who is truthful and respectable. We've all had crushes but that doesn't necessarily mean that we should absolutely date all of them, and it's not the end of the world if our crush rejects us. Just move on and find someone more worthy.

## Sex in Relationships

Another one of those absurd beliefs is that love is all about sex. No, love about sex! 

`"Having sex with someone is easy but being in love with someone is hard."`

Relationships isn't about sex. Just because you want someone to fulfil your sexual desires, it doesn't mean you're in love with them. It's extremely cringy to think that just because you had sex with someone, it means that you two are now in love. Toxic! These stories are all over the place now, and I get it why most teens believe in it. A relationship should never be driven by horniness! Hook-ups aren't synonyms for relationships.

You should only have sex with someone who you trust and love, not with someone who just looks pretty. Nobody wants a STI or STD, so think twice before letting horniness conquer your brain. And pregnancies can certainly ruin lives if it's not well planned.

Sex is addictive but being in love with someone is far more addictive that being in love. If you truly love someone, then having sex with them shouldn't ever matter.

## Conclusion

Being in love through your teenage years is completely normal. After all, it's what makes us who we are, humans. You shouldn't allow yourself to be blinded by ephemeral feelings for people and worse believe that it's love. Love is truly something magical that not even words can truly describe.

If you think you love someone, just imagine the person all wrinkled in a bed and you being on their side, would you still love them? If yes, then it *may be* that you're in love. If it's true love, it shouldn't fade, no matter how long it's been. Relationships can deteriorate, but if both partners are fully committed to loving each other, it will last forever. 

***Remember, Love is beautiful, and by the end of the day it's all up to you to make the right choices.***
