# A blog!?

After much consideration, it has come clear to me that my original idea is not much of a success. The official blog had originally started on [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com) but the technology was not to my comfort. If I were to be honest, it has been holding me off from blogging.

Long before I even created my blogger page, I had a vision in mind. A vision to make my own custom blog site from scratch with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. However, this dream of mind has been put aside on multiple occasions. Procrastination, lack of motivation and too much effort were the driving force which kept off of making one.

Having my own blogger page comes with a handful of advantages and some disadvantages. As it's all done by me, I decide on how to rule over it and what content I can post without it getting moderated. I now have more control over what I expect and what I want, however more control also means that I have a lot more to do. If it was not for [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), none of this would have been possible. I am a young teenager and all young teens know that they would rather spend their money elsewhere than on servers. With the very skills that I have obtained through the years, I have gotten acquainted with web development.

It is with immense **pleasure** that I am able to inaugurate in a sort of way my blog. I love it! It is all I could have asked; it is simple, clean and easy to navigate around. My blog is free of ads and memberships that show up to your face every 20 seconds or so. I am not the most skilled when it comes to designing but I have put all my efforts into turning it into something I can really look up to. 

The main focus of my blogs is not to display my grammar or something along the lines. My goal behind all of this is just to get my messages out there, on a certain "platform" for people to view and appreciate. Most of the posts on here are purely for fun and for entertainment purposes.

*Warm welcome to my blog, Drifting Notes!* I hope that it gets the job I had envisioned done.
