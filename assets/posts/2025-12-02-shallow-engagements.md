# Shallowness of Engagements

Engagement refers to the act of being involved with something or possibly someone. So how can an engagement be shallow and what does that even allude to? Shallow or for a lack of a better word, surface or superficial define engagements which are poorly developed whether voluntarily or not. Reasonably, the next questions are:

- What are examples of shallow engagements or how can I spot them?
- Does it affect me and should I care?
- Are there any remedies to shallow engagements?

Subsequently, I will provide my personal views and insights on these topics; addressing them in what I deem appropriate. (This is a biased reporting, as my thoughts are influenced by my actual views on certain modern inventions and ways.)

## Examples of such engagements

Shallow engagements can be classified into two not necessarily discrete forms, namely: voluntary and involuntary. So what is the difference? 

### Voluntary

Voluntarily would be in cases where one chooses consciously to commit weakly. For instance, a lot of textbooks provide content summaries at the end of chapters. In place of reading the actual content, one would directly skip to the summaries. Another more prominent example would be multi-tasking. That is, doing two completely different tasks at the same time. That, itself, is incredibly broad and holds several interpretations. To further exemplify, reading this while talking to someone or watching short-form content while speaking to someone would be valid arguments that fit directly into this category.

Sometimes these shallow engagements may be advantageous or reasonable to us. For students cramming for summary examinations, reading the end of chapter summaries instead of the actual chapters may be the only sound action in that instance. We make these compromises due to being short of time, wanting to save time or simply because we are fully interested in the task at hand itself.

### Involuntary

In this case, one is not subject to forthright choices but rather pre-determined ones. While it is true that one could argue that in both, the choices are pre-determined. This would be true to a certain extent, but involuntary would be mostly due to pre-determined options or standards set by the society or companies whose products are now integrated parts of our lives. For instance, the advent of messaging applications such as Instagram or Whatsapp or Discord could be the reason behind a lot of our shallow interactions. These apps facilitate communication in unnatural ways. Hence, one may undermine the values of communication, associating it to the click of a mere button from a device that resides mostly in the pocket. These social apps simulate our primal drive for socialisation but quite poorly. Deep meaningful conversations, which are essential for brain development, are replaced by small talks. These companies are profiting off our basic brain functions by offering us services that only address half or lesser fractions of the problem.

### The middle ground

Another more prominent illustration would be the usage of artificial intelligence. Using search engines such as Google, Brave or even DuckDuckGo automatically (involuntarily) offers AI generated summaries of the content. This is convenient for most, but in reality, it is a source of shallow engagement. Ignoring the fact that the summaries may not be accurate, users' need to engage with the topic is reduced or eliminated completely after a quick read of the summary. Likewise, in most cases, they are not able to form their own opinions, but accept the more convenient one provided by the summary.

## The effects

Shallow engagements can deceitfully feel like a super-power. However, this is nothing but an illusion. While one may not always want deep engagements, constant prioritisation of shallow ones can be detrimental. As stated in the `The middle ground` section, it addresses the issue of losing the ability of forming our own opinions. This in short, makes us more vulnerable to large scale manipulations tactics. Once again, multi-tasking can feel like a super-power. However, there is reported evidence that multi-tasking diminishes our brain's ability to tackle problems and eventually leads to difficult long term information retention. Ironically, social media whose sole purpose is to facilitate socialisation, accounts for one in seven adolescents suffering from mental illness, according to the WHO. Instead of facilitating communication, social media renders communicating with people dull and can very easily strip away the joys of participating in deep and meaningful conversation. Likewise, there are countless other scenarios of shallow entertainment unknowingly, or knowingly to some, rendering our lives in living hells. But addressing all of these examples concretely is beyond the scope of this writing. 

## Cures and solutions

In short, we are all victims of shallow engagement, but some more than others. In practice, due to the nature of our societies, it is impossible not to participate in shallow engagements. But this should not serve as a deterrent!
As of all things, the solution is a matter of discipline and how far we are willing to go. Yet, there is no one cure. If something counts as shallow engagement, the solution involves finding ways of counteracting it. For example, if AI is the source of shallow engagement, the most apparent solution is to regulate its usage and to reduce our reliance on it. For the case of multi-tasking, attempt to tackle one task at a time. For shallow conversations, socialise with people who prioritise deep over shallow engagement or rely less on social media.

Coming up with a solution is not necessarily difficult. However, applying the latter is. Success does not always come without failure, and one should never feel discouraged by their previous failures. Instead, analyse them and incorporate them into a more robust solution.
