# My sadness by Frieda


***My sadness***

\
That one addictive feeling

One that I've experienced for thus long

Each of its return uncovers the old friend

I hold it very tightly and onto adventures we go

\
As morbid as it can be

sobbing into my very arms

The ones I know will hold me

\
I can finally collapse into myself

\
The feeling of ever nothingness when I'm done

And sometimes when I'm alone

I sitting while memories flood fast

Faster than I can take time to breath

I drown in the moments that I pass

It feels as in a sudden death

\
But sometimes the pain is what reminds me I'm alive!

*My sadness is a small poem I wrote as a way to describe my sadness.*
