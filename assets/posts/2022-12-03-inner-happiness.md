***This is not going to be a very long blog post but a rather short one.***

I am unsure of how to explain this, but everyone who has ever felt it before will be able to relate. I wouldn't like to say it's an ephemeral feeling but it's not here all the time. It's about feeling good for simply existing.

`I do not believe there's a meaning behind our existence but this shouldn't stop us from being happy. In fact, the reason we living is because of happy.`

There are different types of happiness. The most common happiness in our modern society is materialistic happiness; the happiness that you acquire from objects you bought or own. Part of our society's brainwashing scheme is likely making us think that the only way of achieving happiness is through buying stuff. This is not the case! 

Inner happiness can be triggered through really simple stuff. Sometimes just peeking outside of my window and smelling the smell of rain on leaves and the ground. Closing your eyes, after seeing the beautiful scene, brings feelings that you rarely felt. It is a sort of unity with nature and oneself.

This inner happiness comes from oneself, the universe and nature. It is a state grace, you can't really force yourself to experience it. It happens automatically with your body.

After exercising, I often just find myself a safe place to sit. Being undisturbed and gasping for air. It's then that it occurs, the immense pleasure of being there. Being in a sort of state, where only nature and I exist. I begin to realise the breeze hitting my skin, the smell of sweat or maybe other natural ones, the sound of birds chirping, the often sound of vehicles, the light rays hitting my skin, and a lot more.

It is like being conscious of who we really are, it's then that we experience it. Being conscious of the speck of dust that we are in the whole universe. We realise that nothing we do really matters, and that somehow gives way to a burst of emotions.

***It's pure bliss and divine.***

I am lacking words to describe that feeling. The message I am trying to convey is that you don't need someone to be happy. Your happiness, whether you're with someone or not, will only come from inside. And being with yourself and nature can also trigger that blissful moment. 

It is during that short period that you realise that nothing matters. You accept it, enjoy the pleasure and then it vanishes. It's similar to an orgasm but a non-sexual one where only your mind is involved.

It's arguable but I believe that you can feel happier by being with yourself instead of being around people.
