# Shattered.

Hello.

Every day, as I stare into the mirror, I see an effete figure look back. Sometimes, it sends chills down my spine, but other times, I cannot bother. Maybe, it is my sprouting hair, or maybe the lighting. Deceitful thoughts scavenger my brain; what was a scavenger hunt has become an ocean filled.

On the first day, I brushed it off. However, it was never reciprocal; it never brushed back. Maybe my uncourageous or rationalising thoughts never pushed me to the confrontation. Nevertheless, this catalysed their ruthless actions. Who would be afraid of a chum who has never lashed out and has proper ethics?

I have sobbed day and night on my bed.

Who would be foolish enough to let these arrows penetrate the shield, let alone the barrier? Undeniable, it could never be me; I would never let my guards fall. Never is a strong word, but it had lost its sturdiness over the years, and so had my barrier. It left me hanging. What I spent years reinforcing was nothing but a brittle glass wall. 

I have lost myself. I suppose my eternal flame was as transient as the nature of Granite Plateau Creek. 

Who am I? What do I like? Why am I here?

If only these could be simple rhetorical questions. It is more than an identity crisis. I have lost myself!

Cracking jokes about people has always appeared as a harmless activity to me. The reason was; it had not been a joke from the first day. What do these intimidators want from me? My binding attraction seems to be their milking target. I saw right through their game and even tried succouring the curvature to a slightly straighter one.

It worked. Partially. I could not change people's hearts, but altering my attraction was feasible. Everything has consequences; mine was the deprivation of all happiness. Sweet became bitter.

When I started listening to them, my life shattered. Had I not done so, I could have built a tiara from it. Albeit I am a coward, I am also a fighter. I will not surrender to these offenders, as my remaining time is diminishing. There are only three more years to endure. By chance, I would find myself in a better pack of cards.
