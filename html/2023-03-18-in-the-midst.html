      A messy short story by
      <a href="https://twitter.com/FriedaR_VI">Frieda_VI</a> &lt;3
    </h2>
    <p>
      A kid strolled carefully through a woodland that was both wild and
      organised. He had attractive features and brown skin, yet his disposition
      was gloomy. It was almost as though the entire universe was resting on his
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      He couldn't help but notice the forest's beauty as he walked. The trees
      were big and magnificent, their leaves gently rustling in the breeze. But
      there was something more in the air that he couldn't quite pinpoint. Not
      much later, He became aware of a rustle in the bushes. Having finally
      realised, he froze as a chilly perspiration rolled down his brow. Was it
      one of the celestial creatures he'd heard about?
    </p>
    <p>
      He'd heard stories about powerful creatures with wings and dazzling auras
      that could kill anybody who displeased them. He was about to move when he
      heard a voice. It was a pleasant voice that talked softly to him. He
      turned to see a being of light in front of him. It had wings, just like
      the tales described, yet there was no hatred or malice about it. The
      youngster was perplexed. He'd been trained to fear these beings for they
      were hostile, but this one looked almost serene. It talked to him again,
      and this time he could understand what it said.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he listened, he realised that the angel was telling him about the
      powers that were concealed in him. The woods had blessed him with the
      powers of the wind, the strength of the lightning, and the energy of the
      sun. He was now unique! The boy had always suspected that there was
      something unusual about the forest, but he couldn't put his finger on it.
      But now, he understood it all. The power of the elements were now in him,
      waiting to be tapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forgoing grinned, filled with amazement and excitement he had never
      felt before. He realised that the limits of his previous world were no
      longer here anymore. When the boy approached the angelic being with
      caution to try to test his powers on him with evil, his heart raced with
      excitement and terror. The celestial being towered over him in an
      instance, its wings sparkling in the forest's wonderful light. He could
      feel its great force and was awestruck by their beauty. The being promptly
      disappeared after making his show.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dazzling light suddenly engulfed him, and he felt himself transported to
      another location. As he opened his eyes, he was in a large sanctuary
      surrounded by lofty beams resembling Greek temples that formed a sort of
      circle pattern around the place. When the boy glanced around, he noticed
      that everything appeared to be calm and quiet. Yet the tranquilly was
      fleeting. The place was populated with similar beings to the one in the
      forest. When he got closer to one of them, he heard a thunderous noise and
      the pillars began to crumble. The angels tried fleeing, but it was too
      late. The beams collapsed, and the youngster watched in horror as the
      angels were slaughter one by one, by the falling wreckage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having to watch this massacre was excruciating, and he could feel himself
      drifting away. The beings' warm blood splattered all over him. The child
      strained to open his eyes after hearing a faint voice calling out to him.
      When he opened eyes, he found himself in a black void, encircled by some
      mysterious light. His body was shaking and drenched with perspiration. He
      couldn't believe what he had just witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guilt weighed heavily on the boy as he recalled the unrepairable
      damage he had caused. He was imprisoned in nothingness surrounded by
      darkness and quiet. Perhaps this was his punishment. As he went through
      the abyss, he came onto a spiral stairway that spiralled higher towards a
      brilliant light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youngster felt an odd pull towards the staircase and began ascending
      it. The stairway was unlike any he's ever seen before, and it was covered
      in lush vines. The vines seemed to glow in the dark, standing out against
      the dark abyss. The vines got more vibrant and vivid as he ascended higher
      and higher. He felt a sensation of serenity and tranquillity flowing over
      him, replacing the guilt that had engulfed him just moments previously. He
      was taken aback by the beauty all around him and wondered where this
      stairway would take him. His thoughts splintered as he climbed, a sort of
      repentance for his heinous action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, he made it to the top of the stairway. He was dazzled by the
      bright light and couldn't advance any further. He noticed he was in a
      magnificent garden when his eyes acclimated to the brightness. The garden
      was alie with lovely flowers and lush vegetation all around him. He could
      see a tall guy with long hands in the distance standing by a fabulous
      fountain. When he got closer, he realised it was an angel. The angel
      smiled at him, and the boy felt a sensation of comfort flood all over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a sweet voice, the angel said, &quot;My child, do not be scared. You
      are the chosen one, despite the heavy toil that comes along, your
      adventure has only just begun.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he listened to the angel's words, the child felt a sense of bliss and
      knowledge poured over him. He felt he had a mission and was willing to go
      to any lenght to achieve it. He spent days exploring the garden and
      getting to know everything about the angel and his brothers and sisters
      which were all killed by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guilt wasn't all cleared, he felt a heavy burden of shame in his chest
      as the days passed. He had destroyed a whole celestial sanctuary, and the
      thought of it made him sick to his stomach. He also realised that he
      couldn't stay in this garden forever. He reconstruct a sanctuary,
      somewhere he could feel safe and at peace. A sanctuary where he could
      bring back the ones who died tragically by his powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youngster began to imagine a new universe, focusing all his powers. He
      imagined a large landmass floating high above the skies. The environment
      was magnificent, with enormous pillars evocative of old Greek
      architecture, yet it also made him nervous. When he took in the
      magnificence of his work, he could feel his heart racing in his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the angel returned to the fountain where it had been discovered,
      but it was weak. Before leaving, he clapped his hands, complimenting the
      boy's work. His claps resonated across the universe. He had passed away in
      the fountain's waters and his body turned into to colourful petals.
      Everything which the angel made, even its garden, began to collapse and
      disappear leaving nothing but a void.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child took a step onto one of the floating islands. The sound of water
      trickling from a nearby fountain and the quiet rustle of leaves from vines
      wrapping around the pillars could be heard. It was a calm world, but the
      youngster realised there was more he could do. He closed his eyes and
      focused, eager for the world to take shape. The pillars gradually began to
      climb higher, and the floating islands got larger. The vines thickened,
      and the fountain expanded, splashing water high into the air. With it, the
      angels were backed and looked far happier than they previously were.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youngster kept shaping the world, putting his love and dedication into
      every aspect. He was well aware that this world would never be able to
      replace the one he had destroyed, but it was a start. And maybe, with
      time, he'll be able to forgive himself for what he'd done. He would ensure
      that ever being of this world lived happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child felt a sense of tranquilly sweep over him as he peered out over
      his masterpiece. Years after, the memories of the chaos were erased and
      the place his built continued to thrive. It had become a place where once
      could go to escape the craziness of the outer world. It still had its
      little imperfections but that made it even more perfect. With that
      thinking, he closed his eyes and relaxed into the peace of his creation.
      His now-grown body sank into the dirt of the meadows, and he became no
      more.
