    <h2 class="h2-space" id="what-are-habits">What are habits?</h2>
    <p>
      <em
        >A habit is an action which is done regularly by one, often done without
        even knowing.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      A habit is something quite natural and self-conducted. Mechanical can also
      mean without thoughts; some habits are mechanical whilst most are not.
      Mechanical habits are usually adopted by the brain itself, and thus it's
      incredibly difficult to attempt to break it.
    </p>
    <h2 class="h2-space" id="why-mechanical-habits">Why mechanical habits?</h2>
    <p>
      Mechanical habits are programmed habits to last for a lifetime. So, we can
      attempt to exploit our brain's obsession with patterns to form a habit
      that is advantageous to us. Attempting to initiate such a practice may be
      easy but maintaining it at the very first seconds is quite tough until
      your brain gets fully accustomed to it. A significant amount of time is
      taken by the brain to get used to routines. For this reason, it's
      essential you have a good start, and this post is all about that!
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2-space" id="start">Start</h2>
    <p>
      It may be as easy for some to start and as difficult as breaking a
      mountain for others. Everyone's brain has their own method of functioning
      but the main keynote is discipline. Without self-discipline, you can
      scratch the idea of building a habit.
    </p>
    <h2 class="h2-space" id="how-do-i-become-disciplined">
      How do I become disciplined?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Discipline is the self-culture to control oneself often in the form of
      rules, and if broken, there's likely going to be punishments. You can
      build your discipline based on very <strong>simplistic</strong> concepts.
      Prior to becoming disciplined, there are some prerequisites!
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Trust<br />
          You should trust yourself to the fullest. One should absolutely
          believe in themselves and their capabilities. There isn't anyone
          beside yourself that your brain knows, so your discipline shouldn't
          depend on others. Staying put in the past leads to nowhere, the
          present is forever advancing and you should give yourself more
          chances.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Willpower<br />
          Everything you will ever accomplish literally depends on your
          willpower. Willpower is a huge part of discipline, but your willpower
          will never be constant nor will you have an infinite amount of it. You
          should be determined to reach your goals at all costs; if you're not,
          then the goals you've set aren't meant for you.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Desires and temptations<br />
          Ranging from the wants to watch a TikTok of five seconds to
          <em>the hub</em>; these are all temptations. It's getting increasingly
          hard to control our temptations nowadays when everything we could ever
          wish for literally lies on our screens. This is exactly why we want to
          try our best to resist things. Temptations will always be there, and
          it's up to you to resist them. Giving into them could drain off your
          motivations and willpower.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      To be disciplined implies overcoming your weakness and finding your
      strength so that you can stand for yourself in whatever situations. It may
      be hard at times but know that everyone experiences these situations more
      than once in their life.
    </p>
    <h2 class="h2-space" id="building-habits">Building Habits</h2>
    <p>
      Now that discipline has been covered, we are a few steps away from the
      main goal of this post. Discipline and habits are dependent on each other
      and closely intertwined; without one the other can't exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Habits are all around us, good and bad. From brushing your teeth before
      going to sleep to watching ten hours of TikTok and YouTube content daily,
      these are all habits. Before starting, it's important that you know
      exactly what you want; take a short pause and consider:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Who you want to be</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The goals you want to accomplish</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Things which may stop you</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How you could combat these things</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can even write these points out in your diary or a piece of paper and
      elaborate even more on them. Don't think of them in a general picture,
      consider every little detail and go to the root. You need to have a plan
      of everything you want to accomplish!
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot start a habit if we don't have a proper routine. How do I know
      if I have a proper routine? It's a rather simple question, you go to sleep
      at a reasonable almost constant time daily and wake up at the same time
      without any excuse. As simple as it sounds, it is the basics.
    </p>
    <h2 class="h2-space" id="a-proper-basic-routine">A proper basic routine</h2>
    <p>
      If you do not have a good and proper routine, it's absolutely fine. It's
      quite funny but even the basic stuff has to be planned sometimes. Get a
      piece of paper and a pen, because the brain has more important stuff to
      recall.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Write out a good hour of the day for you to wake up, this could vary
          for every day of the week but it has to be there. Seven o'clock, half
          past six or half past seven, it is up to you to decide!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Do the same thing except for bedtimes now. Keep account for an
          eight-hour sleep, it should neither be less nor more than eight.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We now have our waking up time and bedtime. Add everything in between
          from here: reading a book, going for a walk on Mondays, partying for
          two hours on Tuesday; it is up to you! Just make sure that every item
          has a strict time of when it starts and when it ends.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Leave some space for expansion. We'll discuss about this in the
          <em><strong>How To Habits</strong></em> section…
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If your timetable is overflowing, cut things out and make space for
          unexpected day-to-day activities.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And now you have an ideal routine on paper. After finalising this routine,
      you shouldn't allow yourself to cut anything out and everything mentioned
      in it should be followed. It effectively helps you to be more disciplined.
    </p>
    <h2 class="h2-space" id="how-to-habits">How To Habits</h2>
    <p>
      From here, it is completely straightforward to start a habit. Based on the
      points that you reflected on earlier, your new habit likely will not be a
      bad one. A habit should be beneficial to you in a sort of way, and there
      needs to be a certain motif behind it. Having a reason for practising
      something will keep you motivated until you finally adopt it as an actual
      habit. For better understanding, let's assume that my new habit is going
      on a fifteen minutes' walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code
        >I want to have a fifteen minutes' walk every day to take a break from
        life and work. A walk because it's more beneficial for my eyes which are
        constantly staring at screens.</code
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      In my head, it has to be well and clear that I have a task that I must
      complete daily. As mentioned above, there also needs to be a reason. Your
      reason will serve as a motif and you could use it to get the willpower and
      stop procrastinating… Of course, the new habit will not come naturally,
      unless you're used to the habit, so you have to allocate some time of your
      day to focus on that particular thing. It has to be planned. If you plan
      your things out, you'd find it more motivating to stick to it.
    </p>
    <h2 class="h2-space" id="the-fourteen-days-method">
      The fourteen days method
    </h2>
    <p>
      The fourteen days method is a powerful method you can use to ensure that
      all goes according to plan. It consists of attempting something for just
      two weeks, with serious discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're trying to build a habit but whether you like it or not, you should
      only give yourself two weeks to adapt to the routine. Allow yourself to
      modify it only after the first two weeks. Stay put to the routine for
      these fourteen days, and at no costs should you break it!

      I used to have a really chaotic life which was emotionally and physically
      draining. It was deeply unhealthy! I would go to sleep at around half past
      three in the morning and wake up around eleven o'clock in the morning.
      This was a routine, a nasty one. It wasn't the real me and I wasn't happy
      with the way my life was going. I was indulging myself to be a loser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being friends with the wrong people isn't any good. Whether you like it or
      not, your friends are huge influential figures to you, and sooner or
      later, you'd start adopting their habits, so will they adopt your habits.
      If you're spending your entire day and life with that person, it's
      inevitable to avoid the influence. Choose your friends and people of your
      surroundings wisely. 😉

      Yeah, my life was going downhill. I've tried to change multiple times but
      nothing worked, I gave up only to go back to the same regime. Nothing I
      tried worked. I didn't have a goal behind my habits, my goal was just
      because I needed to do the habits. It wasn't enough to keep me motivated.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the month of November, I decided on trying something new. Assign
      habits to things I liked. I knew that this too could potentially fail. As
      a preventive measure, I set out to try the habit for two weeks. After
      those two weeks, If I didn't like it, I'd stop. If it needed to be
      modified, I'd only modify it after the time has elapsed and retry again.
      If I liked it, I'd keep it ongoing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went through all the steps I've mentioned above. Discipline, I didn't
      have it but I was going to earn it! I had a proper bedtime, wake up time,
      and a timetable of what to do. It was already one o'clock in the morning
      after I was done setting my plan for the week and my alarms. I wasted no
      time and went to sleep. Morning came quickly, I was exhausted. Driven by
      pure willpower, I woke up. There was no time for any distractions and
      surely no time to procrastinate. Once you're on your two feet in the
      morning, it only gets easier from there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of my discipline format was to cut off distractions. As heart
      wrenching as it is, you either set a timer to your distractions or delete
      them completely. I had chosen the timer option, and this truly helped to
      reduce my screen time and helped me become more productive.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2-space" id="what-came-out-of-it">What came out of it?</h2>
    <p>
      Three weeks and a half have already elapsed since I started this routine
      and I am proud to say that it has worked. I didn't get here on my first
      try, and it definitely took a lot of tries to get to where I am.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2-space" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Building habits or even a habit is not an easy task, and it could actually
      take a lot of tries before it actually becomes a
      <em>mechanical</em> habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The take away from this post is that you shouldn't give up on anything.
      Even if you have given up, it's never too late to retry. As reluctant or
      hard as it sounds, it will count if you just give it a try.
