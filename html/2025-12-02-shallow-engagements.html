        Engagement refers to the act of being involved with something or
        possibly someone. So how can an engagement be shallow and what does that
        even allude to?
      </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Shallow or for a lack of a better word, surface or superficial define
      engagements which are poorly developed whether voluntarily or not.
      Reasonably, the next questions are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What are examples of shallow engagements or how can I spot them?</li>
      <li>Does it affect me and should I care?</li>
      <li>Are there any remedies to shallow engagements?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Subsequently, I will provide my personal views and insights on these
      topics; addressing them in what I deem appropriate. (This is a biased
      reporting, as my thoughts are influenced by my actual views on certain
      modern inventions and ways.)
    </p>
    <h2>Examples of such engagements</h2>
    <p>
      Shallow engagements can be classified into two not necessarily discrete
      forms, namely: voluntary and involuntary. So what is the difference?
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Voluntary</h3>
    <p>
      'Voluntarily' is the case where one consciously chooses to commit
      weakly. For instance, a lot of textbooks provide content summaries at the
      end of chapters. In place of reading the actual content, one would
      directly skip to the summaries. Another more prominent example would be
      multi-tasking. That is, doing two completely different tasks at the same
      time. That, itself, is incredibly broad and holds several interpretations.
      To further exemplify, reading this while talking to someone or watching
      short-form content while speaking to someone would be valid arguments that
      fit directly into this category.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes these shallow engagements may be advantageous or reasonable to
      us. For students cramming for summary examinations, reading the end of
      chapter summaries instead of the actual chapters may be the only sound
      action in that instance. We make these compromises due to being short of
      time, wanting to save time or simply because we are not fully interested in
      the task at hand itself.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Involuntary</h3>
    <p>
      In this case, one is not subject to forthright choices but rather
      pre-determined ones. While it is true that one could argue that in both,
      the choices are pre-determined. This would be true to a certain extent,
      but involuntary would be mostly due to pre-determined options or standards
      set by the society or companies whose products are now integrated parts of
      our lives. For instance, the advent of messaging applications such as
      Instagram, Whatsapp or Discord could be the reason behind a lot of our
      shallow interactions. These apps facilitate communication in unnatural
      ways. Hence, one may undermine the values of communication, associating it
      to the click of a mere button from a device that resides mostly in the
      pocket. These social apps simulate our primal drive for socialisation but
      quite poorly. Deep meaningful conversations, which are essential for brain
      development, are replaced by small talks. These companies are profiting
      off our basic brain functions by offering us services that only address
      half or lesser fractions of the problem.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>The middle ground</h3>
    <p>
      Another more prominent illustration would be the usage of artificial
      intelligence. Using search engines such as Google, Brave or even
      DuckDuckGo automatically (involuntarily) offers AI generated summaries of
      the content. This is convenient for most, but in reality, it is a source
      of shallow engagement. Ignoring the fact that the summaries may not be
      accurate, users’ need to engage with the topic is reduced or eliminated
      completely after a quick read of the summary. Likewise, in most cases,
      they are not able to form their own opinions, but accept the more
      convenient one provided by the summary.
    </p>

    <h2>The effects</h2>
    <p>
      Shallow engagements can deceitfully feel like a super-power. However, this
      is nothing but an illusion. While one may not always want deep
      engagements, constant prioritisation of shallow ones can be detrimental.
      As stated in the <strong>The middle ground</strong> section, it addresses the
      issue of losing the ability of forming our own opinions. This in short,
      makes us more vulnerable to large scale manipulations tactics. Once again,
      multi-tasking can feel like a super-power. However, there is reported
      evidence that multi-tasking diminishes our brain’s ability to tackle
      problems, and eventually leads to difficulties in long term information
      retention. Ironically, social media whose sole purpose is to facilitate
      socialisation, accounts for one in seven adolescents suffering from mental
      illness, according to the WHO. Instead of facilitating communication,
      social media renders communicating with people dull and can very easily
      strip away the joys of participating in deep and meaningful conversation.
      Likewise, there are countless other scenarios of shallow entertainment
      unknowingly, or knowingly to some, rendering our lives into living hell.
      But addressing all of these examples concretely is beyond the scope of
      this writing.
    </p>
    <h2>Cures and solutions</h2>
    <p>
      In short, we are all victims of shallow engagement, but some more than
      others. In practice, due to the nature of our societies, it is impossible
      not to participate in shallow engagements. But this should not serve as a
      deterrent! As of all things, the solution is a matter of discipline and
      how far we are willing to go. Yet, there is no one cure. If something
      counts as shallow engagement, the solution involves finding ways of
      counteracting it. For example, if AI is the source of shallow engagement,
      the most apparent solution is to regulate its usage and to reduce our
      reliance on it. For the case of multi-tasking, attempt to tackle one task
      at a time. For shallow conversations, socialise with people who prioritise
      deep over shallow engagement or rely less on social media.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming up with a solution is not necessarily difficult. However, applying
      the latter is. Success does not always come without failure, and one
      should never feel discouraged by their previous failures. Instead, analyse
      them and incorporate them into a more robust solution.
