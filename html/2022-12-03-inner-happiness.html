      I am unsure of how to explain this, but everyone who has ever felt it
      before will be able to relate. I wouldn't like to say it's an ephemeral
      feeling but it's not here all the time. It's about feeling good for simply
      existing.

        shouldn't stop us from being happy. In fact, the reason we living is

      There are different types of happiness. The most common happiness in our
      modern society is materialistic happiness; the happiness that you acquire
      from objects you bought or own. Part of our society's brainwashing scheme
      is likely making us think that the only way of achieving happiness is
      through buying stuff. This is not the case!
    </p>
    <p>
      Inner happiness can be triggered through really simple stuff. Sometimes
      just peeking outside of my window and smelling the smell of rain on leaves
      and the ground. Closing your eyes, after seeing the beautiful scene,
      brings feelings that you rarely felt. It is a sort of unity with nature
      and oneself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This inner happiness comes from oneself, the universe and nature. It is a
      state grace, you can't really force yourself to experience it. It happens
      automatically with your body.
    </p>
    <p>
      After exercising, I often just find myself a safe place to sit. Being
      undisturbed and gasping for air. It's then that it occurs, the immense
      pleasure of being there. Being in a sort of state, where only nature and I
      exist. I begin to realise the breeze hitting my skin, the smell of sweat
      or maybe other natural ones, the sound of birds chirping, the often sound
      of vehicles, the light rays hitting my skin, and a lot more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is like being conscious of who we really are, it's then that we
      experience it. Being conscious of the speck of dust that we are in the
      whole universe. We realise that nothing we do really matters, and that
      somehow gives way to a burst of emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>It's pure bliss and divine.</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am lacking words to describe that feeling. The message I am trying to
      convey is that you don't need someone to be happy. Your happiness, whether
      you're with someone or not, will only come from inside. And being with
      yourself and nature can also trigger that blissful moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is during that short period that you realise that nothing matters. You
      accept it, enjoy the pleasure and then it vanishes. It's similar to an
      orgasm but a non-sexual one where only your mind is involved.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>
        It's arguable but I believe that you can feel happier by being with
        yourself instead of being around people. Realising that you can be happy
        with just yourself, is a completely different feeling.
