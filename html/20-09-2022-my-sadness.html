      <em><strong>My sadness</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      That one addictive feeling<br />
      One that I've experienced for thus long<br />
      Each of its return uncovers the old friend<br />
      I hold it very tightly and onto adventures we go<br />
      <br />
      As morbid as it can be<br />
      sobbing into my very arms<br />
      The ones I know will hold me<br />
      <br />
      I can finally collapse into myself<br />
      <br />
      The feeling of ever nothingness when I'm done<br />
      And sometimes when I'm alone<br />
      I sitting while memories flood fast<br />
      Faster than I can take time to breath<br />
      I drown in the moments that I pass<br />
      It feels as in a sudden death<br />
      <br />
      But sometimes the pain is what reminds me I'm alive!
