    <p>
      <em><strong>My sadness</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      That one addictive feeling
    </p>
    <p>One that I've experienced for thus long</p>
    <p>Each of its return uncovers the old friend</p>
    <p>I hold it very tightly and onto adventures we go</p>
    <p>
      <br />
      As morbid as it can be
    </p>
    <p>sobbing into my very arms</p>
    <p>The ones I know will hold me</p>
    <p>
      <br />
      I can finally collapse into myself
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      The feeling of ever nothingness when I'm done
    </p>
    <p>And sometimes when I'm alone</p>
    <p>I sitting while memories flood fast</p>
    <p>Faster than I can take time to breath</p>
    <p>I drown in the moments that I pass</p>
    <p>It feels as in a sudden death</p>
    <p>
      <br />
      But sometimes the pain is what reminds me I'm alive!
