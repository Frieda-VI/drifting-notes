    <h1 id="a-blog">A blog!?</h1>
    <p>
      After much consideration, it has come clear to me that my original idea is
      not much of a success. The official blog had originally started on
      <a href="https://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> but the technology was not
      to my comfort. If I were to be honest, it has been holding me off from
      blogging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before I even created my blogger page, I had a vision in mind. A
      vision to make my own custom blog site from scratch with pure HTML, CSS
      and JavaScript. However, this dream of mind has been put aside on multiple
      occasions. Procrastination, lack of motivation and too much effort were
      the driving force which kept off of making one.

      Having my own blogger page comes with a handful of advantages and some
      disadvantages. As it's all done by me, I decide on how to rule over it and
      what content I can post without it getting moderated. I now have more
      control over what I expect and what I want, however more control also
      means that I have a lot more to do. If it was not for
      <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>, none of this would
      have been possible. I am a young teenager and all young teens know that
      they would rather spend their money elsewhere than on servers. With the
      very skills that I have obtained through the years, I have gotten
      acquainted with web development.

      It is with immense <strong>pleasure</strong> that I am able to inaugurate
      in a sort of way my blog. I love it! It is all I could have asked; it is
      simple, clean and easy to navigate around. My blog is free of ads and
      memberships that show up to your face every 20 seconds or so. I am not the
      most skilled when it comes to designing but I have put all my efforts into
      turning it into something I can really look up to.

      The main focus of my blogs is not to display my grammar or something along
      the lines. My goal behind all of this is just to get my messages out
      there, on a certain &quot;platform&quot; for people to view and
      appreciate. Most of the posts on here are purely for fun and for
      entertainment purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Warm welcome to my blog, Drifting Notes!</em> I hope that it gets the
      job I had envisioned done.
