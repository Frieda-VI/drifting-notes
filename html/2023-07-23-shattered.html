    <h2>The shared misery of my life...</h2>

    <p>Hello.</p>
    <p>
      Every day, as I stare into the mirror, I see an effete figure look back.
      Sometimes, it sends chills down my spine, but other times, I cannot
      bother. Maybe, it is my sprouting hair, or maybe the lighting. Deceitful
      thoughts scavenger my brain; what was a scavenger hunt has become an ocean
      filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first day, I brushed it off. However, it was never reciprocal; it
      never brushed back. Maybe my uncourageous or rationalising thoughts never
      pushed me to the confrontation. Nevertheless, this catalysed their
      ruthless actions. Who would be afraid of a chum who has never lashed out
      and has proper ethics?
    </p>
    <p>I have sobbed day and night on my bed.</p>
    <p>
      Who would be foolish enough to let these arrows penetrate the shield, let
      alone the barrier? Undeniable, it could never be me; I would never let my
      guards fall. Never is a strong word, but it had lost its sturdiness over
      the years, and so had my barrier. It left me hanging. What I spent years
      reinforcing was nothing but a brittle glass wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have lost myself. I suppose my eternal flame was as transient as the
      nature of Granite Plateau Creek.
    </p>
    <p>Who am I? What do I like? Why am I here?</p>
    <p>
      If only these could be simple rhetorical questions. It is more than an
      identity crisis. I have lost myself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cracking jokes about people has always appeared as a harmless activity to
      me. The reason was; it had not been a joke from the first day. What do
      these intimidators want from me? My binding attraction seems to be their
      milking target. I saw right through their game and even tried succouring
      the curvature to a slightly straighter one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It worked. Partially. I could not change people's hearts, but altering my
      attraction was feasible. Everything has consequences; mine was the
      deprivation of all happiness. Sweet became bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I started listening to them, my life shattered. Had I not done so, I
      could have built a tiara from it. Albeit I am a coward, I am also a
      fighter. I will not surrender to these offenders, as my remaining time is
      diminishing. There are only three more years to endure. By chance, I would
      find myself in a better pack of cards.
